          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty</h2>
          <p>Low-income households are more likely to be uninsured than people from higher income households, 
            but not all uninsured belongs to low income families.      
          </p>

          <p>Texas shows the highest number of uninsured, but does not have the highest number of families in poverty 
            and New Hampshire shows the lowest poverty levels without having the highest health insured rates.
          </p>

          <p>Even though, it is clear that low poverty rates states shows less uninsured percentages than higher poverty states. 
            It seems that helth insurance is conditioned by some other factors, since even mid wealthy or wealthier
            states have low or even lack of a healthcare culture.
